# ðŸš€ Storage Static Website Lab (PaaS Storage)



---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Deploy and host a **static website** from an **Azure Storage account** and practice using **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** for secure, time-limited access.

## âœ… Outcomes
By completing this lab, you will:
- Provision a **StorageV2 account** in an allowed region (`eastus2`).
- Enable **Static Website** hosting on Azure Storage.
- Upload an `index.html` and optional `404.html` page into the `$web` container.
- Verify public access through the static website endpoint.
- Clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs.
