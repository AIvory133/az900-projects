# ðŸš€ VM Webserver Lab (IaaS)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Deploy and host a web page from an Ubuntu Virtual Machine in Azure.  
Practice configuring NSG rules, installing software remotely, and verifying service access.

---

## âœ… Outcomes
By completing this lab, you will:

- Provision an **Ubuntu Linux VM** in an allowed region (`eastus2`).
- Configure **Network Security Group (NSG)** rules for HTTP (80) and SSH (22).
- Install and start **Nginx** using Azure CLI RunCommand.
- Verify public web access through the VMâ€™s public IP.
- Clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
When you finish the lab, delete the resource group to avoid ongoing charges.  
This removes the VM, NSG, NIC, Public IP, and all related resources.
